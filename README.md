## Introduction

This is an interface for connecting the openModelica with openMDAO for optimizing the parameters. This tool allows an automatic loop between simulation and optimisation.

## Environment

1. OMPython
2. OpenMDAO
3. Python 3.9

## Commands

To run this tool, you need to run the below command in terminal:

    # python run.py [command]

Command list:

1. om - run the openModelica simulation only
2. mdao - run openMDAO loop for optimization
3. help - for help
